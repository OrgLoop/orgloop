# PR Review Received

A team member submitted a review on your PR.

## Instructions

1. Read every review comment carefully — understand the full context before responding
2. **Code change requests** → make the fix, push the commit
3. **Questions** → respond with a clear explanation in the PR thread
4. **Disagreements** → explain your reasoning. If the reviewer has a point, make the change
5. After addressing all comments, re-request review from the same reviewer
6. If CI fails after your changes, fix it before re-requesting review

## Guidelines

- Don't batch responses — address each comment individually
- If a comment requires a code change, make it. Don't just acknowledge it
- Keep PR responses concise and technical — this isn't a conversation, it's engineering
- If a review comment reveals a deeper architectural issue, flag it but fix what was asked
