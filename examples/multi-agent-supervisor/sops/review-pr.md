# PR Review Received

A reviewer has submitted feedback on a PR. Address their comments.

## Instructions

1. Read every review comment carefully — understand the full context before responding
2. **Code change requests** -> make the fix, push the commit
3. **Questions** -> respond with a clear explanation in the PR thread
4. **Disagreements** -> explain your reasoning. If the reviewer has a point, make the change
5. After addressing all comments, re-request review from the same reviewer

## Guidelines

- Address each comment individually
- If a comment requires a code change, make it — don't just acknowledge it
- Keep responses concise and technical
