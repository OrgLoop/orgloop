# Linear Ticket Update

A Linear ticket has changed state. Review and take appropriate action.

## Instructions

1. Read the ticket details — title, description, current state, assignee, comments
2. **Ticket moved to "In Progress"** -> pick it up, start working
3. **Ticket moved to "In Review"** -> check if there's a PR associated, review it
4. **New comment on your ticket** -> read and respond or act on it
5. **Ticket created and assigned to you** -> acknowledge, plan your approach, start working

## Guidelines

- Keep the ticket updated with your progress — add comments as you work
- If you're blocked, move the ticket to "Blocked" and explain why in a comment
- Link PRs to tickets so the workflow is traceable
- If a ticket is unclear, ask for clarification in a comment before starting work
